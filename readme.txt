Readme file for "Fast Morphology" plugin for ImageJ

The aim of this program is to provide fast implementation of most morphological
filters for the ImageJ software. This plugin supports basic operations such as
dilation, erosion, opening, and closing, as well as combination of them such as
top-hat, morphological gradient or morphological laplacien. Some utilities such
as chamfer distance maps or image border padding are included for convenience.

Several structuring element shapes are provided: square, diamond, octagon, and 
lines with horizontal or diagonal orientation. For a given shape family, 
several structuring element can be created by choosing the size (given either
as radius or as diameter).

To use the plugin, simply put the "Fast_Morphology.jar" file into the ImageJ
plugins directory, and restart ImageJ. Morphological filters are available 
through the new menu "plugins->Fast Morphology->Morphological Filters".
